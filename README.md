# E-Waste-Classification-Model
My project is on the E-Waste Generation Classification. I am very interested in this domain because it allows me to gain hands-on experience on the AI based project works.

Week-1 : The Improvements i have done so far are :

- Improved error handling for file uploads and class folder checks.
- Added data augmentation (flip, rotation, zoom, contrast) for better generalization.
- Partial fine-tuning of later layers only
- Adaptive epoch count based on dataset size.

The further Improvents to be made for week-2 are :

- Adding precision, recall to the model for better enhancement
- Adding test dataset evaluation.
- Add option to upload multiple images at once for Gradio Interfave.
- User can be able to download the predictions as a report (CSV).


Week-2 : Created a less complexity Model that trains In less time

Further Improvements to be made :
- Checking all other ways by changing various factors in such a way to get more accuracy while predicting

Final Model :

- Created a Hybrid model which uses both convnextiny and efficientnet to train the model
- The results are accurate for any input provided to the model but it is taking time to train the model.

I created Two Models :

1. Model which is lite structured and less time taking to train, Results are accurate
2. Model which uses Hybrid ensemble, so that it takes time to Train, Results are very accurate
